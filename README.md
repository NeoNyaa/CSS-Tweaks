# CSS-Tweaks
CSS tweaks for many webpages that need a little modifying

I highly suggest that you use the extension Stylus as it will make installing and managing these styles significantly easier. You can get it from either of the links below:  
[Stylus for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
[Stylus for Chrome/Chromium based browsers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)

## Installation of styles
1. Navigate to the folder containing the style you would like to install.
2. Find the name of the style you would like to install in the README at the bottom of page.
3. Click on the link of the style you would like to install.
4. Click install style on the stylus window that shows.
